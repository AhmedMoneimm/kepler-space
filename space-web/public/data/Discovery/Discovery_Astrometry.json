        "Introduction": "Astrometry has led to the discovery of 3 planets. This method involves measuring the precise movements of stars in relation to their nearby stellar neighbors. When a planet orbits a star, its gravitational influence can cause the star to exhibit a slight wobble or shift in its position. This wobble is due to the gravitational tug of the planet, resulting in the star's position changing minutely against the backdrop of more distant stars.",
        "Detection": "As a planet orbits its star, the gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to move in a small orbit or wobble around a common center of mass (barycenter). This motion is extremely small and typically requires highly sensitive instruments to detect. Astronomers use high-precision instruments to measure the starâ€™s position over time. By observing how the star shifts in relation to more distant background stars, they can infer the presence of a planet.",
        "Advantages": "Astrometry can provide direct measurements of a planet's mass based on the degree of wobble it induces in its host star. By continuously observing the positions of stars over extended periods, astrometry can reveal the presence of multiple planets around a single star.",
        "Limitation": "Astrometry is most effective for detecting massive planets that are close to their host stars. It is less sensitive to smaller, more distant planets. The method requires long-term observations to detect the subtle changes in a star's position, which can be challenging due to the presence of other factors that can affect a star's motion, such as binary companions or stellar activity."
