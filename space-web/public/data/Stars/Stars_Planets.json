        "How Planets Are Born: From Cosmic Dust to New Worlds": "Ever wonder how planets like Earth are born? It turns out, planets form from the same cloud of gas and dust that creates stars! Here's how the process works:",
        "The Birth of a Star and a Planetary Disk": "When a star is forming in a cloud of gas and dust (called a nebula), gravity pulls everything together. But not all of the gas and dust becomes part of the star. Some of it ends up swirling around the young star, forming a flat disk. This is called a protoplanetary disk, and itâ€™s where planets will eventually take shape.",
        "From Dust to Pebbles": "Inside the disk, tiny dust grains are like the building blocks of planets. Gravity and random collisions cause these dust particles to stick together, slowly forming clumps that grow bigger over time. What starts as dust eventually turns into pebbles and rocks as these particles continue to collide and merge.",
        "Planetesimals: The Big Stuff": "As pebbles become larger rocks, they grow into planetesimals, which are like mini-planets. These planetesimals are the seeds of planets, and they continue to grow by pulling in more material with their gravity.",
        "Clearing Paths in the Disk": "As these young planets-to-be orbit their star, they start to clear out paths in the protoplanetary disk. They absorb or push away the gas and dust around them, carving out lanes like cars on a racetrack.",
        "Millions of Years Later: Planets Are Born": "Over millions of years, these planetesimals keep growing, merging with other objects, and eventually become full-fledged planets. Some might become rocky planets like Earth, while others could grow into gas giants like Jupiter."
