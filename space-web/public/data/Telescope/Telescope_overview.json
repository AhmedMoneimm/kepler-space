        "Introduction": "The first planets discovered outside our solar system, called exoplanets, were really strange. Some orbited pulsars—stars that are the leftover cores of exploded stars—and were blasted by radiation regularly. Another was a giant planet, almost like Jupiter, but it was so close to its star that it only took four days to complete one orbit, or one “year. These extreme planets were easier to find because of the technology we had in the 1980s and '90s. Back then, ground-based telescopes on Earth helped find the first wave of exoplanets. However, Earth’s atmosphere made it hard to get clear views. Once we put telescopes in space, above the atmosphere, we could see much more, finding thousands of exoplanets, including some about the size of Earth and in areas around stars where life could potentially exist. Now, with the next generation of space telescopes, scientists are getting ready to study these planets even more closely by examining their atmospheres for signs of life.",
        "Telescopes": "NASA has several space telescopes studying the universe right now: Hubble, Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Chandra X-ray Observatory, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array), the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer on the International Space Station, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), and the James Webb Space Telescope"
