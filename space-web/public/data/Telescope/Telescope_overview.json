        "The First Strange Exoplanets": "The first exoplanets discovered were truly bizarre. Some orbited pulsars—the remnants of exploded stars—and were blasted by radiation, while others were giant planets that completed orbits in just four days, hugging their stars tightly. In the 1980s and '90s, ground-based telescopes found these extreme planets, but Earth’s atmosphere limited our view. When telescopes were sent into space, we uncovered thousands of exoplanets, some the size of Earth, and in regions where life might exist. Now, with the next wave of space telescopes, we’re ready to study their atmospheres, searching for signs of life.",
        "Our Tools for Exploring Exoplanets": "NASA's fleet of space telescopes is working hard to explore the universe and exoplanets. This includes iconic observatories like Hubble, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the newly launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with powerful tools like the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and more. These instruments allow scientists to probe distant worlds, unlocking the mysteries of planets far beyond our solar system."
