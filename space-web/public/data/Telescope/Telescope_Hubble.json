        "Hubble’s Early Role in Space Exploration": "Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope became one of the most important tools in astronomical discovery. While it is best known for its breathtaking images of galaxies, nebulae, and distant stars, Hubble also played a crucial role in the early search for planets beyond our solar system—known as exoplanets. Orbiting above Earth's atmosphere, Hubble captured clearer and more detailed images of the universe than ground-based telescopes ever could.",
        "Hubble’s Unexpected Contribution to Exoplanet Science": "Although Hubble wasn’t specifically designed to find exoplanets, its high-resolution imaging and ability to observe in ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths made it a valuable asset in exoplanet research. It helped confirm the existence of some of the first exoplanets and provided critical insights into their atmospheres—something ground-based telescopes struggled to achieve. In fact, Hubble was one of the first telescopes to directly observe light from an exoplanet and to measure its chemical makeup.",
        "Hubble’s Lasting Legacy in Exoplanet Research": "Hubble's significant contributions include the detection of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other molecules in the atmospheres of distant planets. One of its greatest accomplishments was producing some of the first atmospheric profiles of exoplanets, offering new information about their composition and conditions. These discoveries laid the foundation for the James Webb Space Telescope to continue the search for habitable worlds. Even after more than 30 years in service, Hubble remains a key player in exoplanet research, inspiring future generations of astronomers with its continued discoveries and stunning images."
