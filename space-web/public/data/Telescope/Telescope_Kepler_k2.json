        "Kepler’s Mission: A New View of Exoplanets": "Launched in 2009, NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope transformed our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. Its goal? To search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of their stars, where life-sustaining conditions might exist. Using the transit method, Kepler detected tiny dips in starlight as planets passed in front of their stars. Over its four-year mission, it monitored 150,000 stars and discovered more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets, showing us that planets are common throughout the universe.",
        "The K2 Mission: Kepler’s Second Chance": "In 2013, a mechanical issue nearly ended Kepler’s mission, but NASA found a solution! In 2014, the telescope began a new chapter with the K2 mission, continuing its exoplanet search while also observing star clusters, supernovae, and active galaxies. Despite the reduced capabilities, K2 made a huge impact, discovering hundreds more exoplanets and contributing valuable data to exoplanet science.",
        "Kepler’s Legacy: A Cosmic Revolution": "Kepler was decommissioned in 2018, but the data from both its original mission and K2 are still being analyzed by scientists today, leading to new exoplanet discoveries years after the telescope stopped operating. Kepler and K2’s legacy lies in their profound impact on our understanding of planetary systems, expanding the possibility of finding habitable worlds beyond our solar system."
