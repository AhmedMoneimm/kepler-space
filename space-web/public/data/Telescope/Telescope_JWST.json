        "The Launch of JWST: A Game-Changer in 2021": "In 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was launched, marking a major leap in space science. With a sunshield the size of a tennis court and a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is the largest and most advanced observatory ever sent into space. Operating primarily in the infrared spectrum, JWST is designed to study the early history of the universe, shedding light on the formation of planetary systems and providing detailed analyses of exoplanet atmospheres.",
        "JWST's Mission: Discovering New Worlds": "JWST is set to be the leading space observatory for the next decade, building on the discoveries made by earlier missions like Hubble and Kepler. With its advanced technology, scientists will be able to study the chemical compositions of distant planet atmospheres, searching for signs of life and evaluating the habitability of these far-off worlds.",
        "Ground Observatories: Partnering in Exoplanet Discovery": "In addition to space telescopes like JWST, NASA partners with ground-based observatories to study exoplanets. Telescopes like Magellan II, NEID, and Keck help confirm discoveries made by missions like TESS, determining the mass, composition, and other vital characteristics of these planets, such as whether they are rocky or gaseous.",
        "The Future of Exoplanet Exploration: A Collaborative Effort": "As JWST works together with ground-based observatories, we will gain a deeper understanding of exoplanets and their potential for supporting life. This collaboration between space and ground telescopes will allow scientists to better explore the universe and uncover the mysteries of distant worlds."
