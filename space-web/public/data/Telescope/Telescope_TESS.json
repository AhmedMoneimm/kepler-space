        "A New Era in Exoplanet Discovery": "Launched by NASA in 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) builds on the success of the Kepler mission but employs a different strategy. While Kepler focused on small sections of the sky, TESS conducts a more comprehensive all-sky survey, covering both hemispheres and aiming to observe around 85% of the sky. This broad approach enables TESS to detect exoplanets around nearby stars that are closer, brighter, and easier to study than those discovered by Kepler.",
        "Utilizing the Transit Method": "TESS uses the transit method, similar to Kepler, to look for dips in starlight caused by planets passing in front of their host stars. This technique allows astronomers to infer the presence of an exoplanet based on the temporary decrease in brightness of a star.",
        "Targeting Nearby Stars": "What sets TESS apart is its focus on stars within about 200 light-years of Earth. TESS targets stars that are typically 30 to 100 times brighter than those observed by Kepler. This brightness enhances the effectiveness of follow-up studies using ground-based telescopes, allowing scientists to refine measurements of the planets' masses, sizes, and atmospheres. This detailed information is crucial for assessing the potential habitability of these exoplanets.",
        "A Rich Diversity of Exoplanets": "TESS is expected to discover thousands of exoplanets, ranging from small, rocky worlds to larger gas giants. Its broader survey methodology enables it to identify planets across a variety of stellar environments, providing scientists with a more diverse sample for study.",
        "Paving the Way for Future Research": "Importantly, TESS helps lay the groundwork for future missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST aims to further explore the atmospheres of some of the planets discovered by TESS, searching for signs of habitability or even life.",
        "A Transformative Tool in Exoplanet Research": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) represents a transformative leap in our ability to discover and study exoplanets. By targeting nearby stars and employing the transit method, TESS is poised to enhance our understanding of planetary systems and contribute significantly to the ongoing quest to find potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system."
