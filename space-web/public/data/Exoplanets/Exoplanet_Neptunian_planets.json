        "Body1": "Neptunian Planets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus. Out of all the exoplanets discovered, about 1,900 of them are Neptunian planets. They have thick atmospheres mostly made of hydrogen and helium, with rocky or metallic cores. These planets are usually found far from their stars, where it's cold enough for gases to freeze into ice, earning them the nickname Ice Giants. While smaller than gas giants like Jupiter, Neptunian planets are still much larger than Earth—about 17 times its mass and four times its size.",
        "Body2": "A smaller version of these is the Mini-Neptune. Mini-Neptunes are smaller than Neptune but bigger than Earth. They have thinner atmospheres than regular Neptunian planets, but their atmospheres are still thicker than Earth's. These planets are usually cold on the surface but have warm cores since they orbit far from their stars. Some scientists believe that Mini-Neptunes were once warmer, larger planets that shrank over time.",
        "Body3": "Another interesting type of Neptunian planet is the Hot Neptune. These planets are about the same size as Neptune but orbit much closer to their stars, making them extremely hot—sometimes over 900°C! Hot Neptunes are rare, and there's a region in space called the “Hot Neptune Desert”, where we find very few of them. Scientists think that these planets might have evaporated due to their stars' intense heat, losing their atmospheres and shrinking into smaller planets like Mini-Neptunes."
