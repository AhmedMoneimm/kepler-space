        "What Are Neptunian Planets?": "Neptunian planets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus. Out of all the exoplanets discovered so far, about 1,900 of them are classified as Neptunian planets. They have thick atmospheres made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Core: These planets have rocky or metallic cores deep inside. Location: Neptunian planets are usually found far from their stars, in regions cold enough for gases to freeze into ice, earning them the nickname Ice Giants. Size Comparison: While they are smaller than gas giants like Jupiter, Neptunian planets are still much larger than Earth—about 17 times its mass and four times its size!.",
        "What Are Mini-Neptunes?": "A smaller version of Neptunian planets is called a Mini-Neptune. Size: Mini-Neptunes are smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth. Atmosphere: They have thinner atmospheres compared to regular Neptunian planets, but their atmospheres are still thicker than Earth’s. Temperature: These planets are usually cold on the surface, but they have warm cores since they orbit far from their stars.Origin Theory: Some scientists believe that Mini-Neptunes were once warmer, larger planets that shrank over time.",
        "What Are Hot Neptunes?": "Another interesting type of Neptunian planet is the Hot Neptune. Size: Hot Neptunes are about the same size as Neptune. Orbit: They orbit much closer to their stars, making them extremely hot—sometimes reaching temperatures over 900°C! Rarity: Hot Neptunes are rare, and there’s a region in space known as the “Hot Neptune Desert”, where very few of them are found. Evaporation Theory: Scientists think that these planets might have evaporated due to their stars' intense heat, causing them to lose their atmospheres and shrink into smaller planets like Mini-Neptunes."
