        "Body1": "Gas Giants are planets that are as large as, or even bigger than, Jupiter or Saturn. They are mostly made of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun. Out of the 5,600 exoplanets we’ve discovered so far, around 1,800 of them are classified as gas giants. Unlike Earth, gas giants don’t have a solid surface. Instead, they have thick, swirling layers of gas above a solid core buried deep inside.",
        "Body2": "A special type of gas giant is called a Hot Jupiter. These are gas giants that orbit very close to their stars. Because they are so close, they get extremely hot—sometimes so hot that their atmospheres get blown away by their star’s intense radiation, leaving behind a rocky core. This leads to intense weather like supersonic winds. These planets orbit their stars so tightly that they make their stars wobble, which scientists can detect by studying the light the star emits."
