        "Body1": "Terrestrial Planets are Earth-sized or smaller, primarily composed of rock, silicate, water, or carbon. While they may not always have atmospheres or oceans, some show potential for habitability.",
        "Body2": "These planets typically have a bulk composition dominated by rock or iron, giving them a solid surface or, in some cases, a liquid one. They can also have gaseous atmospheres, although this is not a defining feature.",
        "Body3": "Larger terrestrial exoplanets—those at least twice as massive as Earth—are classified as Super-Earths. These planets can have a variety of characteristics and conditions, but they are generally more massive than Earth.",
        "Body4": "While many terrestrial planets could be candidates for hosting life, scientists have not yet confirmed whether they have the necessary conditions, like water or a stable atmosphere, to support life.",
        "Body5": "One fascinating example is the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is similar to our solar system. It contains seven Earth-sized planets, four of which might be classified as Super-Earths. All of these planets have the potential to have water on their surfaces, making them exciting targets for future discovery and exploration.",
        "Body6": "Some potentially habitable planets may exist in binary systems, where two stars orbit each other, providing unique conditions for their planets. As of now, only 205 terrestrial planets have been discovered, and research is ongoing to learn more about their characteristics and the possibility of finding life beyond Earth."
