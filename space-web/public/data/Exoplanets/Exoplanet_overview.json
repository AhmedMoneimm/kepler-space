        "Introduction": "An exoplanet, also called “extrasolar planet”, is a planet that exists outside of our solar system and orbits a star other than the Sun. Some exoplanets, called rogue planets, don’t orbit any star and instead float through space on their own. So far, scientists have “confirmed” the existence of over 5,600 exoplanets, but they believe there are billions more waiting to be discovered. Using advanced telescopes, we’ve learned a lot about these distant worlds, and in some cases, we’ve even captured images of them!",
        "Body": "Exoplanets are everywhere in the universe. Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered so far are located in a relatively small area of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The Milky Way is an enormous galaxy, and scientists believe there are exoplanets orbiting stars all over it. Some of the closest exoplanets to Earth are just a few light-years away, which is the farthest distance our current technology can observe. The closest one is Proxima Centauri b, which is about 4 light-years away in the Alpha Centauri star system. Proxima Centauri b is a rocky planet that orbits its star in the habitable zone—the area where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist. Because of this, scientists consider it one of the most exciting places to search for life beyond Earth."
