        "What is an Exoplanet?": "An exoplanet, also known as an extrasolar planet, is a planet that exists outside our solar system. Unlike the planets that orbit our Sun, exoplanets orbit other stars. Some exoplanets, called rogue planets, don’t orbit any star at all. Instead, they float freely through space on their own!",
        "How Many Exoplanets Are There?": "So far, scientists have confirmed the existence of over 5,600 exoplanets. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg! Scientists believe there are billions more waiting to be discovered.",
        "The Search for Exoplanets": "Using advanced telescopes, we’ve learned a great deal about these distant worlds. In some amazing cases, we’ve even managed to capture images of them!",
        "Where Are Exoplanets Found?": "Exoplanets are found all over the universe, but most of the ones we’ve discovered so far are located in a relatively small area of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The Milky Way is enormous, and scientists believe that exoplanets are orbiting stars throughout the galaxy.",
        "Closest Exoplanets to Earth": "Some of the closest exoplanets to Earth are just a few light-years away, which is the farthest distance our current technology can observe. The closest confirmed exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b, located about 4 light-years away in the Alpha Centauri star system.",
        "Why Is Proxima Centauri b Special?": "Proxima Centauri b is a rocky planet that orbits its star in the habitable zone—this is the region where conditions might be just right for liquid water to exist. Because of this potential for water, scientists consider Proxima Centauri b one of the most exciting places to search for life beyond Earth."
