        "What is an Exoplanet Candidate?": "An exoplanet candidate refers to a potential planet that telescopes have detected in space. These candidates arise from intriguing observations in data collected by astronomers, but scientists need further investigation to determine if they are indeed real planets. In some cases, exoplanet candidates may turn out to be \"false positives\", meaning they are not planets at all but rather other astronomical phenomena or artifacts in the data.",
        "Confirming a Planet's Existence": "To confirm the existence of an exoplanet, scientists typically require observations from two additional telescopes to gather more data. This confirmation process is essential to ensure that the detected signal is genuinely from a planet rather than a misleading anomaly. Currently, there are thousands of exoplanet candidates awaiting confirmation, but verifying each one can be time-consuming and expensive due to the complexity of the required observations and analyses.",
        "The Role of Amateur Scientists": "Amateur scientists play a crucial role in the ongoing search for exoplanets. By analyzing data from NASA and other sources, enthusiastic individuals can assist in narrowing down which exoplanet candidates warrant further investigation. While computers may overlook subtle changes in brightness that indicate the presence of a planet, humans are often adept at spotting these details. This makes amateur astronomers valuable allies in the quest to discover new worlds and expand our understanding of the universe.",
        "The Collaborative Effort in Exoplanet Discovery": "The search for exoplanets is a collaborative effort involving professional astronomers and dedicated amateur scientists alike. By working together, they contribute to the ever-growing list of potential planets and help uncover the mysteries of our cosmos."
