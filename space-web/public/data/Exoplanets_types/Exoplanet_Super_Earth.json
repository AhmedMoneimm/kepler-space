        "The Rocky Worlds of Our Galaxy": "Terrestrial planets are defined as those that may or may not have atmospheres. They are generally larger than Earth but lighter than Neptune. The composition of these planets can vary significantly; they can be made of gas, rock, or a combination of both, depending on their temperatures. The temperature of terrestrial planets changes based on their distance from their star, affecting their potential for habitability. To date, scientists have discovered around 1,700 of these exoplanets, which are quite common in our galaxy and come in various forms.",
        "The Oceans of the Cosmos": "Water worlds, also known as ocean worlds, are exoplanets that contain large amounts of water in any form. This can include vast oceans, ice, or water vapor in the atmosphere. The presence of water is a key factor in assessing the potential for life, making these planets intriguing subjects of study for scientists.",
        "The Icy Giants of Space": "Snowball planets are largely covered in ice and are extremely cold. They resemble giant snowballs floating in space due to their icy surfaces. These planets exist in regions far from their stars, where temperatures are low enough to maintain a solid ice cover. Understanding snowball planets can provide insight into the conditions under which icy worlds can form and evolve.",
        "The Gaseous Behemoths": "Neptune-like planets are primarily made up of dense gases, similar to Neptune. Among these, larger exoplanets known as super-Earths can be classified as sub-Neptunes or mini-Neptunes. These classifications refer to planets that have a composition similar to Neptune but are still rocky. The study of Neptune-like planets helps scientists understand the diversity of planetary systems and the factors that influence their formation."
