        "The Amazing Variety of Exoplanets": "Exoplanets come in all shapes and sizes. Some are gas giants even larger than Jupiter, while others are small and rocky, comparable to the size of Earth or Mars. These distant worlds can host extreme environments—some can be so hot that metal would melt on the surface, while others are so cold that they’re frozen solid. There are exoplanets that orbit their stars so closely that a year lasts only a few days, and others that orbit two suns at once, reminiscent of the planet Tatooine from Star Wars. Fascinatingly, there are even rogue planets that don’t orbit any star and wander through space in total darkness. Each exoplanet looks different, depending on its composition, and no two are exactly alike! Exoplanets are categorized into the following types based on their size and composition:",
        "Gas Giants: The Massive Behemoths": "Gas giants are planets the size of Jupiter or Saturn, or even much larger. These massive worlds are primarily composed of gases and can have thick atmospheres that extend far into space.",
        "Neptunian: The Thick-Atmosphered Planets": "Neptunian planets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus. They have thick atmospheres made mostly of hydrogen and helium, giving them a unique appearance and composition.",
        "Super-Earth: The Intermediate Giants": "Super-Earths are planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. These planets may be rocky, like Earth, or possess thick atmospheres, leading to diverse environments and potential for habitability.",
        "Terrestrial (Rocky): The Solid Surface Worlds": "Terrestrial planets, such as Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are rocky and have solid surfaces. They are usually found closer to their stars and can support various environments, making them interesting candidates for the search for life."
