General questions
Scientific terms
Exoplanet types:
1. Gas Giants1851: are planets of size Jupiter or Saturn including:
   1. Hot Jupiters: similar to Jupiter but extremely close to their star. This makes their temp reach thousands of degrees. This leads to intense weather like supersonic winds.
2. Neptunian planets1964: are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus (called “ice giants”) that have a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium with metallic and rocky core, including:
   1. Mini-Neptune: smaller than Neptune but larger than earth. They have thinner atmospheres than other neptunian planets but still thicker than earth atmospheres. They are usually cold on the surface and warm in the core as they orbit far away from their star
   2. Hot Neptunes: same size of Netunian planets with high degree ~900 but much harder to find. There is a mysterious hot-neptune desert that suggests that either these planets are rare or they were common in the past but have transformed (evaporated due to their star radiation then escaped like a hot air balloon). The evaporation transitions then from hot and very warm big Neptunes to  cold “mini neptune”.
3. Super-Earths1732: terrestrial planets that may or may not have atmospheres. They are massive than Earth but lighter than Neptune and can be made of gas, rock or both depending on the temperature. They are common among planets found in our galaxy and may exist in many forms:
   1. Water Worlds(Ocean worlds): have large amount of water in any form (Ocean, ice , water vapor
   2. Snowball Planets: largely covered in ice and very cold
   3. Neptune-like: made of dense gasses, usually the super-Earth planets with upper limit size (very large) are called sub-Neptunes or mini-Neptunes
4. Terrestrial Planets205: are earth sized and smaller, composed of rock, silicate, ware or carbon. Not clear if they have atmospheres, oceans or any sign of habitability. The most habitable world but not guaranteed. There is a system like the solar system called TRAPPIST-1 system that has 7 earth-size planets (4 might be super-earth) all of them with potential of water on their surface but still under discovery. Some of the habitable planets may be binary systems.
How to find a Planet:
Radial Velocity Method for Discovering Exoplanets (Watching for Wobble)18.9%:
The Radial Velocity Method has been used to discover 1,091 exoplanets. It works by detecting the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets. When a planet orbits a star, the gravitational interaction causes the star to move slightly in response, creating a wobble in space. This motion can be observed because it changes the star's light due to the Doppler effect.

In this "game of gravity," the bigger the planet, the stronger its gravitational force on the star, which leads to a more pronounced wobble. Massive planets, like Jupiter, cause more noticeable effects.

How We Detect the Wobble:
The wobbling star emits light that shifts in frequency as it moves:
* When the star moves towards us, the light is shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum (blue shift).
* When the star moves away from us, the light is shifted towards the red end (red shift).
By carefully analyzing these shifts, astronomers can deduce the presence of planets around the star. This technique is known as Doppler Spectroscopy.

Tools Used:
1. Spectrographs: Specialized instruments that break the star’s light into its component wavelengths. By analyzing these spectra, astronomers detect minute shifts caused by the star's motion.
   * HARPS (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) and HIRES (High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer) are two of the most widely used spectrographs in this method.
2. Telescopes: Ground-based telescopes equipped with spectrographs are essential for collecting the light from distant stars. Some of the leading observatories include:
   * ESO 's La Silla Observatory in Chile.
   * Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
3. Computing Software: Once the data from spectrographs is collected, astronomers use software to analyze the frequency shifts and deduce the presence and properties of the orbiting planets.


Key Points:
* The Radial Velocity Method doesn’t measure the size of the planet directly but rather its effect on the star’s motion.
* It is one of the first successful methods used to detect exoplanets and is often used to confirm discoveries made by other methods.
* It is especially useful for finding massive planets close to their stars, which create larger wobbles.
Transit Method (Searching for Shadows)74.5%:
The Transit Method has been used to discover 4,291 planets. This method works by observing the dimming of a star's light when a planet passes directly between its star and the observer (on Earth). Similar to a solar eclipse, the planet blocks a portion of the star’s light for a brief period, leading to a measurable dip in the star’s brightness. This periodic dip in brightness is recorded as a light curve (the relationship between light intensity and time), which allows astronomers to detect the presence of a planet.
How the Transit Method Works:
* Size and Duration of the Transit: By analyzing the size and length of the dip in the light curve, astronomers can determine the size and speed of the planet.
   * Larger, slower, and more distant planets block more light and for a longer period of time than smaller, faster, and closer planets.
   * The depth of the light curve dip gives the planet's size, while the interval between dips provides the orbital period and speed of the planet.
* Multiple Planets: If the light curve has mixed signals (irregular dips or multiple dips), it may indicate the presence of multiple planets orbiting the star. In such cases, further observations are required to differentiate the characteristics of each planet.
Additional Information from Transits:
* Atmospheric Composition: During a transit, some of the star’s light passes through the planet’s atmosphere. By analyzing this light using transit spectroscopy, astronomers can study the planet’s atmosphere and detect the presence of specific gases. Different elements in the atmosphere allow certain wavelengths of light to pass through, which can reveal the composition of the atmosphere (e.g., water vapor, methane, oxygen).
* Planetary Temperature and Habitability: Follow-up observations in infrared wavelengths can provide information about the planet’s temperature, and help determine whether the planet lies within the star’s habitable zone (where conditions could support liquid water and potentially life).
Tools Used:
1. Space Telescopes:
   * Kepler Space Telescope and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) are two key space-based observatories designed to monitor stars for planetary transits.
2. Ground-Based Telescopes: Some ground-based telescopes can also monitor for transits, though space telescopes are preferred because they avoid atmospheric interference.
3. Photometers: Instruments that precisely measure the light intensity of stars, allowing astronomers to detect the small dips in brightness caused by planetary transits.
Notable Discoveries:
* NASA's Kepler Mission, launched in 2009, has been instrumental in using the Transit Method to discover thousands of exoplanets, including many multi-planet systems.
Key Points:
* The Transit Method doesn't measure the planet's mass but can estimate its size, orbital period, and atmospheric composition.
* It is especially effective at finding smaller planets, such as Earth-sized planets, which might not create detectable gravitational effects on their stars (as in the Radial Velocity Method).
* The Kepler Mission and TESS have been crucial in identifying exoplanets using this method.
Direct Imaging of Exoplanets(Taking Pictures)1.4%:
As of now, 82 planets have been discovered using direct imaging. This method allows astronomers to take pictures of exoplanets by removing the overwhelming glare of the stars they orbit. Exoplanets are extremely far from Earth, often millions of times dimmer than their host stars, making traditional imaging methods, like those used for planets in our own solar system (e.g., Jupiter or Venus), exceedingly difficult. However, new techniques and rapidly advancing technology are making direct imaging of exoplanets possible.
Challenges in Direct Imaging:
The primary challenge astronomers face when trying to image exoplanets is that the stars they orbit are millions of times brighter than the planets themselves. Any light reflected off the planet or heat radiation emitted by the planet is overwhelmed by the massive amount of light from the star. It’s like trying to spot a flea next to a lightbulb or a firefly beside a spotlight. This makes it extremely difficult to separate the faint light from the planet from the glare of the star.
Blocking the Glare (Shine Blockers):
To overcome this, astronomers use specialized instruments designed to block out the overwhelming starlight, much like how you might use sunglasses or a sun visor to block sunlight on a bright day. By reducing the star's glare, they can get a clearer look at the objects around the star, which might be exoplanets.
Techniques for Blocking Light:
Astronomers use two main methods to block the light from a star and directly image exoplanets:
1. Coronagraphy:
   * This technique involves placing a device called a coronagraph inside a telescope to block the starlight before it reaches the telescope’s detector. The coronagraph acts as an internal “light-blocker” within the telescope, helping astronomers observe the surrounding region for exoplanets. Ground-based observatories are now using coronagraphs to successfully image exoplanets.
2. Starshade:
   * A starshade is a separate device that is positioned between the telescope and the star to block the star's light before it even enters the telescope. For space-based telescopes, a starshade would be a separate spacecraft that carefully positions itself at the correct distance and angle to perfectly block out the starlight while allowing the telescope to capture images of the surrounding region, potentially revealing exoplanets.
Future of Direct Imaging:
Direct imaging of exoplanets is still in its early stages, but it holds tremendous potential as a method for both finding and characterizing exoplanets. Future advancements in direct imaging technology may allow astronomers to take detailed photos of exoplanets, revealing features such as atmospheric patterns, oceans, and even landmasses. This could provide groundbreaking insights into the composition and habitability of these distant worlds.


Gravitational Microlensing (Light in a Gravity Lens)3.9%:
Gravitational microlensing has been responsible for the discovery of 225 planets. This method relies on a fascinating phenomenon predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, where the gravity of a massive object, such as a planet, can bend and focus the light from a distant star. Essentially, the planet acts like a lens, magnifying the light from a background star as it passes between the star and an observer on Earth.
How It Works:
* When a massive object (e.g., a planet) moves in front of a more distant source star, the gravity of the object bends the light coming from the star in a process called gravitational lensing.
* As the planet crosses directly in front of the star from our viewpoint on Earth, the light from the star is magnified due to the bending of light by the planet’s gravitational field.
* This magnification creates a characteristic light curve that briefly brightens the distant star. By analyzing this light curve, astronomers can infer the presence of the planet and its properties.
Key Features:
* No Light from the Planet: Unlike the transit or radial velocity methods, microlensing doesn’t rely on light from the planet itself. Instead, it detects the effect of the planet’s gravity on the light from the background star.
* Can Detect Distant Planets: Microlensing is particularly useful for detecting planets that are far from Earth and orbit their stars at great distances. It’s also one of the few methods that can detect free-floating planets, which are not bound to any star but still bend light as they pass by.
* Single-Event Detection: A microlensing event is typically one-time only for a given star-planet alignment. This makes it different from methods like transit or radial velocity, where repeated signals can confirm a planet's orbit. Microlensing events are often monitored by dedicated surveys that continuously observe large areas of the sky.
Tools Used:
1. Observatories: Ground-based and space-based observatories play a crucial role in detecting microlensing events. Some notable observatories include:
   * The Keck Observatory: Located in Hawaii, it has powerful telescopes capable of monitoring large areas of the sky.
   * The Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System): This project focuses on scanning the sky for transient events, including microlensing occurrences.
   * The Subaru Telescope: Also located in Hawaii, it has been instrumental in detecting gravitational microlensing events.
2. Dedicated Surveys:
   * The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE): This long-term survey has been specifically designed to monitor microlensing events towards the Galactic Bulge and has contributed significantly to planet discoveries.
   * The Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA): Another dedicated survey that works in conjunction with OGLE to monitor for microlensing events.
3. Data Analysis Software: Astronomers utilize various software tools to analyze light curves from microlensing events. These tools help in fitting models to the observed data and extracting information about the planet's characteristics.
Advantages:
* Sensitive to Low-Mass Planets: Gravitational microlensing is sensitive enough to detect planets with relatively low masses, even those that are farther from their stars (beyond the habitable zone).
* Can Detect Planets Around Distant Stars: This method can detect planets around stars that are located thousands of light-years away, providing insight into planetary systems across a wide range of distances.
Limitations:
* Single Event: Microlensing events are transient and happen only once as the planet passes in front of the star. It’s not possible to observe the same event again, making follow-up observations of the detected planet challenging.
* Difficulty in Characterizing Planets: While microlensing can confirm the presence of a planet, it doesn’t offer much detailed information about the planet’s size, atmosphere, or other characteristics, compared to other methods like transit spectroscopy.
Astrometry (Minuscule Movements)
Astrometry has led to the discovery of 3 planets. This method involves measuring the precise movements of stars in relation to their nearby stellar neighbors. When a planet orbits a star, its gravitational influence can cause the star to exhibit a slight wobble or shift in its position. This wobble is due to the gravitational tug of the planet, resulting in the star's position changing minutely against the backdrop of more distant stars.
How It Works:
* Wobbling Motion: As a planet orbits its star, the gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to move in a small orbit or wobble around a common center of mass (barycenter). This motion is extremely small and typically requires highly sensitive instruments to detect.
* Precise Measurements: Astronomers use high-precision instruments to measure the star’s position over time. By observing how the star shifts in relation to more distant background stars, they can infer the presence of a planet.
Key Features:
* Sensitive to Large Planets: Astrometry is particularly effective for detecting large planets that are relatively close to their stars since their gravitational influence is stronger and causes more noticeable wobbles.
* Three-Dimensional Motion: Unlike other methods that primarily observe changes in brightness (like transit or radial velocity), astrometry provides a three-dimensional view of stellar movements, helping to deduce the mass and orbit of the planet.
Tools Used:
1. Space Telescopes: Space-based observatories are crucial for astrometry, as they are less affected by atmospheric interference. Notable telescopes include:
   * Gaia: A European Space Agency mission designed for astrometry, Gaia is mapping the positions of over a billion stars with exceptional precision, making it possible to detect the minuscule wobbles caused by orbiting planets.
2. Ground-Based Telescopes: High-resolution ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics can also contribute to astrometric measurements, although they face challenges from atmospheric distortions.
3. Data Analysis Software: Specialized software is employed to analyze positional data over time, allowing astronomers to model the star's movements and deduce the presence and characteristics of any orbiting planets.
Advantages:
* Direct Measurement of Planet Mass: Astrometry can provide direct measurements of a planet's mass based on the degree of wobble it induces in its host star.
* Long-Term Monitoring: By continuously observing the positions of stars over extended periods, astrometry can reveal the presence of multiple planets around a single star.
Limitations:
* Sensitivity to Distance: The effectiveness of astrometry decreases for stars that are very distant or for planets that are small, as the wobbles they induce may be too subtle to detect.
* Challenges in Interpretation: Distinguishing between different factors that might cause stellar motion (such as the gravitational influence of other stars) can complicate the analysis.
Discovery Facility(Telescopes):
First exoplanet evidence was in 1917 but first discovery was in the 1990s.
The discovery of exoplanets grew exponentially after launching the Kepler Space Telescope.
The Kepler mission was to survey the milky way to discover earth-size and smaller planets near the habitable zone(Godilocks zone), and determine the stars that might have planets. After the second of Kepler’s 4 gyroscope-like wheels failed in 2013, Kepler completed its prime mission in november and began its extended mission K2. The Spacecraft was retired in 2018, but Kepler data are still being used to find exoplanets.
NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope(2013-2020) was not designed to search for exoplanets, but its infrared instruments made it an excellent exoplanet explorer. It was used in the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 system.
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS):
TESS was launched as a successor to Kepler to discover exoplanets in orbit around the brightest dwarf stars (most common star type in our galaxy). TESS also finds and monitors all types of objects that change in brightness, from nearby asteroids to pulsating stars and distant galaxies containing supernovae.
NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope and future Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: 
Hold great promise for what they can learn from exoplanets.
They use spectroscopy for reading light signatures for information.
Confirmed vs. Candidate:
An exoplanet candidate is a possible planet that a telescope has spotted, but scientists aren't sure if it really exists yet. Sometimes, these candidates turn out to be "false positives," meaning they aren't planets after all. A planet becomes "confirmed" when two other telescopes take more observations and prove it's real. Right now, there are thousands of planet candidates waiting to be confirmed, but using telescopes for this is time-consuming and expensive. That's where amateur scientists can help! By looking at NASA data, people like us can help narrow down which candidates to investigate, and maybe even discover new planets. While computers might miss tiny changes in brightness, humans can often spot them and help identify planets that might be out there.
Naming:
Exoplanet names may seem complicated, but they follow a system. The first part of the name is usually the telescope or survey that discovered the planet. The number shows the order in which the star was cataloged, and the lowercase letter (starting with "b") indicates the order in which planets were found, with "b" being the first planet discovered. Stars get capital letters, while planets get lowercase ones. For example, Kepler-16b means the Kepler telescope discovered the system, 16 is the star's catalog number, and "b" is the first planet found around that star. If Earth were named like an exoplanet, it would be called "Sun d." 
But how do they name the rogue planets that don’t have a system of stars ??
Stars:
  

Stars are the most basic building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of stars trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of their galaxy. Stars are responsible for the production and distribution of heavy elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
How are stars born:
Stars are formed in huge clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Over time, gravity pulls parts of these clouds together, causing them to collapse that makes the center heats up, forming a "protostar," which is the beginning of a new star. 
Sometimes, the cloud splits into two or more parts, forming multiple stars. The leftover gas and dust that doesn’t become part of the star can form planets, moons, asteroids, or just stay as dust in space.
Main sequence:
As a protostar's core gets hotter over millions of years, nuclear fusion starts, marking the star's entry into the "main sequence" phase, which is the longest stage of its life. During this stage, the star converts hydrogen into helium through fusion, producing massive energy that keeps it hot and bright. This energy also balances the star’s gravity, preventing it from collapsing. Most stars in the galaxy, like our Sun, are in the main sequence phase.
Star’s color meaning:
When you look at the night sky, you may notice that some stars shine more brightly than others. The brightness of a star is related to how much energy it puts out, as well as how close it is to Earth. Stars come in different colors depending on their temperature. Hot stars are blue or white, while cooler ones appear orange or red. Astronomers classify main sequence stars based on color and temperature into categories: O (blue, hottest), B (blue-white), A (white), F (yellow-white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red, coolest). Stars at the end of their lives, like supergiants, red giants, and white dwarfs, are no longer in the main sequence. 
Our Sun is a G-type yellow-dwarf main sequence star. It's predicted that the sun will live for a few billion more years.
Stars can live for billions of years but vary according to their size where bigger live shorter because they burn nuclear fuel faster.
How planets form around stars:
The gas and dust surrounding a forming star are essential for creating planets. Scientists believe that planets start as tiny dust grains, forming in a disk around young stars. Through gravity and collisions, these dust particles combine into larger objects, like pebbles and rocks. As they orbit the star, they clear paths in the disk, and over millions of years, this disk transforms into new planets.
Life cycles of stars:
1. Red giant and white dwarfs: When a star like our Sun runs out of hydrogen, it collapses and heats up enough to fuse hydrogen in a shell around its core, becoming a red giant. In about 5 billion years, our Sun will expand so much that it will swallow Mercury. After burning helium the core will shrink , increasing the gravity, making the sun hotter that creates a lot of energy that the outer layer will become even bigger than the distance from the earth to the Sun. Then after a billion years as a red giant, the sun will eject its outer layer till the sun is only a core called white dwarf that is roughly the size of earth but has mass of a star. The smaller the white dwarf the more its mass is until it fades into oblivion as they cool down. This is the fate of stars whose mass is up to 1.4 times of our sun, bigger stars have different fate.
2. White dwarfs may become novae: If a white dwarf forms in a binary or multiple star system, it may experience a more eventful fate as a nova.  Nova is Latin for "new". It was thought that novae are newly born stars but today they are just very old stars - white dwarfs. If a white dwarf is close enough to a companion star, its gravity may drag matter (hydrogen) from the outer layer of the neighboring star and start building itself. When enough hydrogen is gathered a nuclear fusion starts causing the dwarf to brighten and eject its remaining material. Sometimes massive dwarfs may collect so much mass thay collapse and explode completely, called supernova.
3. Going supernova: In a nova, only the star's surface explodes. In a supernova, the star's core collapses and then explodes. Stars more than eight times the mass of our Sun end their lives in a supernova, which is a massive explosion caused by the collapse of the star's core after it produces iron. Once a star's core collapses, it shrinks rapidly, creating extreme temperatures. This leads to a violent explosion that can outshine an entire galaxy for weeks. Supernovae also produce various elements and particles, contributing to the universe's chemistry.
4. Neutron stars and pulsars: If the core of a collapsing star in a supernova has 1.4 to 3 times the mass of the Sun, it forms a neutron star, where protons and electrons combine into neutrons. Neutron stars are extremely dense and have strong gravity and magnetic fields. These fields can create beams of radiation that sweep like a lighthouse. If these beams point toward Earth, we observe them as pulses of radiation, and the star is called a pulsar.
5. Blackholes: If the core left after a supernova is more than three times the Sun's mass, it collapses into a black hole, an object so dense that not even light can escape. Black holes are detected indirectly, either by observing the high-energy radiation from matter falling into them or by watching the effects of their gravity on nearby stars. For instance, astronomers monitor stars rapidly orbiting around the invisible supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
6. From the remains, new stars and planets arise: The dust and debris left behind by novae and supernovae, as well as by red giants puffing off their outer layers, eventually blend with the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, forming new nebulae. The products created in the end of the lives of stars enrich galaxies with heavy elements and chemical compounds. Eventually, those materials are recycled, providing the building blocks for new generations of stars and planetary systems.
Extra Types:
1. Red dwarfs: Red dwarfs form in the same way as other stars. They begin as dense pockets in a cloud of gas and dust (a nebula), which collapse under gravity to form a protostar. As the core heats up, nuclear fusion starts, converting hydrogen into helium. Red dwarfs are smaller and cooler than larger stars, allowing them to burn hydrogen slowly for trillions of years without significant changes in their structure. Unlike larger stars, they don't go through phases like becoming red giants or supernovae.
2. Brown dwarfs aren’t technically stars. They’re more massive than planets but not quite as massive as stars. Generally, they have between 13 and 80 times the mass of Jupiter. They emit almost no visible light, but scientists have seen a few in infrared light. Some brown dwarfs form the same way as main sequence stars, from gas and dust clumps in nebulae, but they never gain enough mass to do fusion on the scale of a main sequence star. Others may form like planets, from disks of gas and dust around stars.
Why exploring exoplanets:
1. Search for life beyond earth: Scientists explore exoplanets to answer profound questions about life in the universe. Is life common or incredibly rare? How quickly does it emerge, and how long can it survive? By studying planets with diverse properties, researchers aim to identify those that might harbor life. A central mystery remains: are we truly alone? With no evidence of other civilizations yet, the search for intelligent life continues, driven by curiosity and the desire to understand our place in the cosmos. These questions fuel the urgency behind exploring exoplanets and the unknown.
2. Can we find life: So far the only life we know exists on Earth, but what makes life on Earth?? Is it the atmosphere, liquid water, good temperature, solid core or planet composition? The Jamess Webb telescope and similars could pick up signs of a similar atmosphere of earth(oxygen, carbon dioxide). One of the indications of the presence of life. Also pollution as our pollution can be detected as a sign of technology hence life. 
3. Where should we look: The search for life is time and money consuming so we cannot track life on over 5700 planets. So we need to narrow down the number to look into planets in the habitable zone of their star. The habitable zone (goldilocks’ zones) is the orbital distance from a star where temperature would potentially allow liquid water to form on a planet’s surface. Other criteria like planet’s size, is it a rocky planet, what type is its star as truly knowing distant exoplanets requires knowledge of the stars they orbit;
4. Why we search: The ultimate goal of NASA's Exoplanet Program is to find unmistakable signs of current life. Exoplanets’ atmospheres may reveal signs of life through detailed analysis using transmission spectroscopy. This technique captures light passing through a planet's atmosphere, which creates a spectrum with dark lines, like a barcode. The missing parts of the spectrum indicate the presence of specific gasses. For example, methane and oxygen together could suggest life, while smog may indicate burning hydrocarbons.

Missions:
NASA has several space telescopes studying the universe right now:
   * Hubble
   * Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer
   * the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
   * Chandra X-ray Observatory
   * Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
   * NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array)
   * the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer on the International Space Station
   * the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)
   * and the James Webb Space Telescope
Legacy of Hubble: Hubble -a Space telescope- that orbits the earth, was pioneer in search for planets around other stars. Hubble even has been used to make some of the earliest profiles of exoplanet atmospheres.
Kepler and K2: NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope made groundbreaking discoveries of over 2,600 exoplanets by detecting tiny dips in starlight as planets passed in front of stars. From 2009 to 2013, Kepler observed over 150,000 stars before technical issues ended its first mission. In 2014, its second mission, K2, continued to discover planets despite reduced capabilities. Although decommissioned in 2018, researchers continue to analyze Kepler's data, uncovering new exoplanets years after its operations ended.
Spitzer: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope explored the universe in infrared light, revealing new stars hidden in dust clouds. It retired in 2020 but its data will continue to fuel discoveries for years. Spitzer, one of NASA's four Great Observatories, was crucial in exoplanet research, especially with its detection of the TRAPPIST-1 system, where it measured the masses and densities of seven Earth-sized planets. After 16 years of service, Spitzer's legacy continues as scientists analyze its extensive collection of data.
TESS: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continues the work started by Kepler, but instead of focusing deeply on small sections of the sky, TESS conducts an all-sky survey, studying both hemispheres. It searches for exoplanets around nearby stars, which are brighter and easier to observe than those studied by Kepler. TESS's broader approach aims to cover 85% of the sky, finding planets around stars within 200 light-years. These planets are easier to follow up with ground-based observations, helping scientists refine their understanding of their masses, sizes, and atmospheres.
James Webb Space Telescope: In 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) launched, marking a groundbreaking step in space science. With its sunshield the size of a tennis court and a 6.5-meter primary mirror, it's the largest and most advanced observatory sent into space. Operating in the infrared spectrum, JWST will study the universe's early history, potentially revealing key details about the formation of planetary systems and analyzing exoplanet atmospheres. JWST is expected to be the premier observatory of the next decade, building on the discoveries of previous missions.
Ground-based telescope: NASA collaborates globally to study exoplanets, using both space-based and ground-based telescopes. Ground telescopes, such as Magellan II, NEID, and Keck, complement space missions like TESS by confirming exoplanet discoveries and measuring their mass. These observations help scientists determine exoplanet characteristics, like whether a planet is rocky or gaseous. Future space telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, will work with ground observatories to analyze exoplanet atmospheres and compositions, providing a deeper understanding of these distant worlds.
