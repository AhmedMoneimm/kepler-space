        "Body1": "In 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was launched, representing a major advancement in space science. With its sunshield the size of a tennis court and a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is the largest and most sophisticated observatory ever sent into space. Designed to operate primarily in the infrared spectrum, JWST aims to study the early history of the universe, uncovering vital information about the formation of planetary systems and providing in-depth analyses of exoplanet atmospheres.",
        "Body2": "JWST is expected to be the leading observatory of the next decade, building on the discoveries made by earlier missions like Hubble and Kepler. Its advanced capabilities will allow scientists to investigate the chemical compositions of exoplanet atmospheres, searching for signatures of life and assessing the potential habitability of distant worlds.",
        "Body3": "In addition to space-based telescopes like JWST, NASA collaborates globally with ground-based observatories to study exoplanets. Ground telescopes such as Magellan II, NEID, and Keck play a crucial role in confirming exoplanet discoveries made by missions like TESS and measuring their mass and other characteristics. These observations help scientists determine the physical properties of exoplanets, such as whether they are rocky or gaseous.",
        "Body4": "As JWST and other future space telescopes work alongside ground observatories, they will provide a more comprehensive understanding of exoplanets, enhancing our knowledge of these distant worlds and their potential for supporting life. This collaboration between space and ground-based technologies represents a powerful synergy in the ongoing quest to explore and understand the universe."
