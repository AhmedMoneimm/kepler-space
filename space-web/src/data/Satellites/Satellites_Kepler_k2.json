        "Body1": "The Kepler Space Telescope, launched by NASA in 2009, revolutionized our understanding of planets beyond our solar system. Its primary mission was to search for Earth-sized planets in or near the habitable zones of their stars, where conditions might be suitable for life. Kepler did this by using the transit method, which involved detecting tiny dips in starlight as planets passed in front of their stars. Over its four-year mission, Kepler monitored over 150,000 stars and discovered more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets, revealing that planets are common in the universe. Many of these planets were in multi-planet systems, some in orbits that allowed for liquid water, key for life as we know it.",
        "Body2": "In 2013, a mechanical issue ended Kepler's original mission, but NASA found a way to repurpose the telescope. In 2014, Kepler embarked on a new mission called K2, continuing the hunt for exoplanets while also observing other astronomical phenomena such as star clusters, supernovae, and active galaxies. Despite its reduced capabilities, K2 contributed significantly to exoplanet science, discovering hundreds of additional planets.",
        "Body3": "Kepler was decommissioned in 2018, but the data from both its original mission and K2 are still being analyzed by scientists today, leading to new exoplanet discoveries years after the telescope stopped operating. Kepler and K2â€™s legacy lies in their profound impact on our understanding of planetary systems, expanding the possibility of finding habitable worlds beyond our solar system."
