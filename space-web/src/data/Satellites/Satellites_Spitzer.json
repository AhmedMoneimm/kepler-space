        "Introduction": "The Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in 2003, was the last of NASA's Great Observatories, designed to observe the universe in infrared light. Infrared light, emitted by warm objects like stars and planets, can pass through gas and dust clouds that block visible light. This allowed Spitzer to reveal previously hidden details of the universe. Named after physicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr., who proposed space-based telescopes, Spitzer was decommissioned in 2020, but its discoveries continue to shape our understanding of the universe.",
        "Body": "NASAâ€™s Spitzer Space Telescope made major contributions by observing in infrared light, uncovering new stars and planetary systems hidden within dust clouds. It played a key role in exoplanet research, particularly in detecting and studying the TRAPPIST-1 system, with its seven Earth-sized planets. Although retired in 2020, Spitzer's 16 years of data will continue to drive scientific discoveries for years to come."
