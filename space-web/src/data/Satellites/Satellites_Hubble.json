        "Body1": "The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, was a groundbreaking tool for astronomical discovery, orbiting above Earth's atmosphere to capture detailed images of the universe. While Hubble is best known for its stunning images of galaxies, nebulae, and distant stars, it also played a key role in the early search for planets around other stars—known as exoplanets.",
        "Body2": "Hubble wasn’t originally designed to find exoplanets, but its high-resolution imaging and ability to observe in ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths made it a valuable asset in exoplanet science. Hubble helped confirm the existence of exoplanets early on and was used to study their atmospheres, something that ground-based telescopes couldn't easily achieve. It became one of the first telescopes to directly observe light from an exoplanet and measure the chemical makeup of an exoplanet’s atmosphere.",
        "Body3": "Hubble’s contributions to exoplanet research include the detection of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. One of its most significant achievements was creating some of the first atmospheric profiles of exoplanets, revealing important details about their composition and conditions. This ability to analyze exoplanet atmospheres paved the way for more advanced space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, to further explore the potential habitability of distant worlds. Even after more than 30 years in operation, Hubble continues to contribute to our understanding of exoplanets, as well as providing breathtaking images of the universe that inspire future generations of astronomers."
