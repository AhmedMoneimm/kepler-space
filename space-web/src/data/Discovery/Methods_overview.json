        "Introduction": "How do scientists discover exoplanets? Planets are typically billions of times fainter than the stars they orbit, and they are incredibly distant, that makes finding them not so easy. The challenges of finding exoplanets are mainly in these 4 basic facts: 1. Planets are small and faint compared to stars. 2. Planets don't produce any light. 3. Planets are far away from us. 4. Planets are faint compared to the background stars. To overcome these challenges, scientists use a variety of methods to detect exoplanets. Most of these methods are indirect, meaning they don't directly observe the planet itself, but instead look for signs of its presence based on how it affects its parent star, for example, by causing it to wobble or dim slightly. Here are some of the most common methods used to discover exoplanets:",
        "Methods": "The Transit Method, The Radial Velocity Method, The Direct Imaging Method, The Microlensing Method, The Astrometry Method, The Pulsar Timing Method, The Orbital Brightness Modulation Method, The Eclipse Timing Variation Method, The Orbital Phase Curve Method, The Polarimetry Method, The Spectroscopy Method, The Gravitational Microlensing Method, The Doppler Spectroscopy Method, The Transit Timing Variation Method, The Reflection Effect",
        "Main": "All these methods are currently used by scientists to discover exoplanets. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and some are better suited to finding certain types of planets than others. By combining data from multiple methods, scientists can learn more about the properties of exoplanets, such as their size, mass, and composition, and even search for signs of life. But the most common 5 methods are the Transit Method, the Radial Velocity Method, the Direct Imaging Method, the Microlensing Method, and the Astrometry Method."
